In Cuba, ballet remains a proud beacon of the revolution: an art form as beloved as a national sport and one of the nation’s proudest cultural exports. But with the country facing what may be its worst crisis since the revolution, many dancers are making the hard decision to leave. Today, there are just 55 dancers in the National Ballet — a company that has at times had more than 100 dancers — bringing it back to its size in its infancy. (A representative from the National Ballet declined to comment on how many dancers have left in recent years or on how the economic situation is affecting the company.)

The company that became the National Ballet of Cuba was founded in 1948 by Alicia Alonso and her husband, Fernando. Melding classical technique with what she considered a natural musicality in Cuban culture, the company emerged as one of the world’s best.

After the 1959 revolution, the company was nationalized and Alonso emerged as an artistic powerhouse of the new nation. Not only did her dancers tour abroad, winning international acclaim, but they also went to small towns and remote provinces in Cuba, building a nationwide appreciation for ballet. (Alonso, nearly blind, danced into her 70s and led the company until her death at 98, in 2019.)

Since the revolution, though, Cuban dancers have slipped away, seeking opportunities, both creative and financial, abroad. In 1966, 10 dancers defected, requesting political asylum in Paris at the International Dance Festival. In 2003, 20 dancers defected during international tours. In the 2010s, small groups fled during performances in Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico.

Around that time, international relations were being relaxed and Cuba appeared to be on an economic upturn. Then, the first Trump administration imposed new penalties and the coronavirus pandemic halted tourism.
